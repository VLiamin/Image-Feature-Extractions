# Different methods for extracting numerical features from images
 This repository contains projects for extracting features from images. These features can be used for subsequent training of neural networks.
This repository contains projects on the following methods:
1. Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
2. Fuzzy Local Binary Pattern (FLBP)
3. Haralick Text Feature Based Method

All projects are implemented using the programming language c#.
