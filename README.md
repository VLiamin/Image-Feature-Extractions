# Different methods for extracting numerical features from images
This repository contains projects for extracting features from images. These features can be used for subsequent training of neural networks. All this programs save data to two files in the root: labels and features.
This repository contains projects on the following methods:
1. Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
2. Fuzzy Local Binary Pattern (FLBP)
3. Haralick Text Feature Based Method
4. Local Density Function
5. Fast Fourier transform (FFT)
6. Wavelet Transform

All projects are implemented using the programming language C#.
